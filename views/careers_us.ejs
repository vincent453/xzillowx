        <h4>Sales, Sharing or Targeted Advertising</h4>
        <p>Except as otherwise described in our Privacy Notice in connection with personnel acting in their capacity as website visitors, we do not sell personal data about individuals acting in their capacity as personnel, and we do not share or otherwise disclose personal data about individuals acting in their capacity as personnel to third parties for the purpose of displaying advertisements that are selected based on personal data obtained or inferred over time from an individual’s activities across businesses or distinctly-branded websites, applications, or other services (otherwise known as “targeted advertising” or “cross-context behavioral advertising”).</p>

        <h1>Our Retention of Personal Data
        </h1>
        <p>We strive to retain personal data only for as long as is reasonably necessary to fulfill the purpose for which it was collected. However, if necessary, we may retain personal data for longer periods of time, until set retention periods and deadlines expire, for instance where we are required to do so in accordance with legal, tax, and/or accounting requirements set by a legislature, regulator, or other government authority.</p>
        <p>To determine the appropriate duration of the retention of personal data, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of personal data and if we can attain our objectives by other means, as well as our legal, regulatory, tax, accounting, and other applicable obligations.</p>
        <p>Once retention of the personal data is no longer necessary for the purposes outlined above, we will either delete/destroy or deidentify the personal data or, if this is not possible (for example, because personal data has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store the personal data and isolate it from further processing until deletion or deidentification is possible.
        </p>

        <h1>Sensitive Information of Personnel and Related Persons</h1>
        <p>The following personal data elements we collect about our personnel and our personnel’s family members and other related persons may be classified as “sensitive” under certain privacy laws (“sensitive information”):</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Social Security Number, driver’s license number, passport number;</li>
          <li>Work-related accounts and passwords;</li>
          <li>Financial account information;</li>
          <li>Credit/debit card number plus expiration date and security code (CVV); and</li>
          <li>Information relating to racial and ethnic origin, religious beliefs, health, disabilities, sexual orientation, gender identity and transgender status.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>We use this sensitive information for the purposes set forth in the Our Collection and Use of Personal Data section above.
          </p>
          <p>We do not sell sensitive information, and we do not process or otherwise share sensitive information for the purpose of targeted advertising. However, subject to certain legal limitations and exceptions, you may be able to limit our processing of sensitive information (as described in the Your Privacy Choices section below).</p>

          <p>You also have the right to not receive retaliatory or discriminatory treatment in connection with a request to exercise the above rights. However, please note that if the exercise of these rights limits our ability to process personal data, we may no longer be able to engage with you in the same manner.</p>

          <h3>Submitting Privacy Rights Request</h3>
          <p>To submit a request to exercise one of the privacy rights identified above, please:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Contact your HRBP; or</li>
            <li>Email <a href="">privacy@zillow.com</a> </li>
          </ul>


          <p>Before processing your request, we will need to verify your identity and confirm you are a resident of the State of California. In order to verify your identity, we will generally either require the successful authentication of your work-related account, or the matching of sufficient information you provide us to the information we maintain about you in our systems. As a result, we require requests to include: your name, dates of employment, and (if available) employee ID number. We may at times need to request additional personal data from you, taking into consideration our relationship with you and the sensitivity of your request. 
          </p>

          <p>In certain circumstances, we may decline a privacy rights request, particularly where you are not a resident of the State of California or where we are unable to verify your identity. </p>

          <h3>Submitting Authorized Agent Requests</h3>
          <p>In certain circumstances, you are permitted to use an authorized agent to submit requests on your behalf through the designated methods set forth above where we can verify the authorized agent’s authority to act on your behalf. In order to verify the authorized agent’s authority, we generally require evidence of either (i) a valid power of attorney or (ii) a signed letter containing your name and contact information, the name and contact information of the authorized agent, and a statement of authorization for the request. Depending on the evidence provided, we may still need to separately reach out to you to confirm the authorized agent has permission to act on your behalf and to verify your identity in connection with the request.
          </p>

          <h3>Appealing Privacy Rights Decisions</h3>
          <p>Depending on your state of residency, you may be able to appeal a decision we have made in connection with your privacy rights request. All appeal requests should be submitted via email to <a href="">zgprivacy@zillowgroup.com</a> or to your HRBP.</p>
